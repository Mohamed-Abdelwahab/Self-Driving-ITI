Task 1:
arguments=['1.8', '.5', '1', '-1.57', '0', '0', 'base_footprint', 'imu_link'],
arguments=['1.8', '.03', '1', '0', '0', '0', 'base_footprint', 'zed2_link'],

Comment : right direction is negative



Task2:
Great work . That was almost perfect.
Comment: Your pitch sequence is : - pi/6 -> 0 -> pi/6 -> -pi/6
There is a sudden change from  pi/6 to -pi/6, A smooth change would be better.
For example:
-pi/6 -> 0. -> pi/6 -> 0 -> -pi/6 and so..
